.TH autojump 1 "10 February 2009" "1.0" "A faster way to navigate your filesystem"
.SH NAME
autojump \- a faster way to navigate your filesystem
.SH SYNOPSIS
.\" Syntax goes here. 
.B j 
dirspec
.P
.B jumpstat
.SH DESCRIPTION
One of the most used shell commands is "cd". A quick survey among my friends revealed that between 10 and 20% of all commands they type are actually cd commands! Unfortunately, jumping from one part of your system to another with cd requires to enter almost the full path, which isn't very practical and requires a lot of keystrokes.
.P
.B autojump
is a faster way to navigate your filesystem. It works by maintaining a database of the directories you use the most from the command line. The 
.B jumpstat
command shows you the current contents of the database. You need to work a little bit before the database becomes useable. Once your database is reasonably complete, you can "jump" to a directory by typing:
.P
.B j
dirspec
.P
where dirspec is a few characters of the directory you want to jump to. It will jump to the most used directory whose name matches the pattern given in dirspec. Note that autojump isn't meant to be a drop-in replacement for cd, but rather a complement. Cd is fine when staying in the same area of the filesystem; autojump is there to help when you need to jump far away from your current location.
.P
Autojump supports autocompletion. Try it!
.SH EXAMPLES
.B j
mp3
.P
could jump to "/home/gwb/my\ mp3\ collection", if that is the directory in which you keep your mp3s.
.P
.B jumpstat
.P
will print out something in the lines of:
.P
54.5:	/home/shared/musique
.P
60.0:	/home/joel/workspace/coolstuff/glandu
.P
83.0:	/home/joel/workspace/abs_user/autojump
.P
97.9:	/home/joel/workspace/autojump
.P
141.8:	/home/joel/workspace/vv
.P
161.7:	/home/joel
.P
Total key weight: 1079
.P
The "key weight" reflects the amount of time you spend in a directory.
